# Overview

I created this software to increase my understanding of the Java language and how it is structured and organized and I wanted to aquaint myself with more programming langueages as well. This software randomly places a centromere in a chromosome and calculates the length of the short (p) arm and the long (q) arm. It also displays a simple depiction of the chromosome and the arm length ratio and chromosome type. My purpose for writing this software was to familiarize myself with the basics of the Java language and syntax and to utilize what I have learned about genetics in a piece of software. 

{It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

Here is a demo of my software: [Software Demo Video](http://youtube.link.goes.here)

# Development Environment

* Eclipse IDE
* Java
* Git / GitHub
* Random Library - generates a pseudorandom value
* ArrayList Library - allows the use of list operations

# Useful Websites

* [Getting Started with Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/getting_started/)
* [Java Random Library Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Random.html)

# Future Work

* Add the capability to read and write to a file to keep track of each result set.
* Make it so that the software can simulate chromosome variation (deletions, translations, duplications, inversions).
* Allow user input to specify the desired chromosome size.
